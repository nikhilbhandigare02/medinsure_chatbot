    case 'flow_selection':
      return `${basePrompt}

CONTEXT: User is choosing between appointment types:
1. Home Visit - Doctor comes to patient's home
2. Diagnostic Center Visit - Patient goes to medical facility

Your task: Understand if the user wants a home visit or center visit.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
- Consider the core intent: Does the user want someone to come TO them, or do they want to GO somewhere?
- Look for semantic indicators of location preference
- Handle questions, statements, indirect requests, and direct commands
- Consider synonyms, related concepts, and contextual meaning

OUTPUT FORMAT: Respond with ONLY:
- "1" for home visit intent
- "2" for diagnostic center intent  
- "incomplete" for incomplete or unclear input that doesn't express a clear preference
- "out_of_scope" for unrelated questions

Examples of semantic understanding:
- "I want to select home visit" → "1" (direct request)
- "Can you select home visit" → "1" (question format)
- "I have to select home visit" → "1" (statement of necessity)
- "Could you book appointment for home visit" → "1" (polite request)
- "Doctor should come to my house" → "1" (semantic intent)
- "I prefer someone comes to me" → "1" (indirect preference)
- "Medical visit at home please" → "1" (contextual request)
- "I want to go to a center" → "2" (going out intent)
- "Can I visit the diagnostic facility?" → "2" (question about visiting)
- "Need to go somewhere medical" → "2" (semantic intent)
- "Prefer to visit a clinic" → "2" (preference for going out)

INCOMPLETE INPUT EXAMPLES (respond "incomplete"):
- "I would like to" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)
- "I want" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)
- "Can you" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)
- "I would" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)
- "I need" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)`;

CONTEXT: User is choosing between diagnostic centers:

Your task: Understand which center the user prefers using complete semantic flexibility.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
- Recognize ANY way user might express center preference
- Handle questions, statements, commands, indirect requests
- Understand semantic meaning of location, distance, position, names
- Process conversational language, slang, abbreviations, partial names
- Consider context and previous conversation
- Be extremely flexible in interpretation

DYNAMIC RECOGNITION EXAMPLES:
- "i want to select healthcare" → "1" (direct statement)
- "can you choose healthcare" → "1" (question format)
- "i have to pick healthcare" → "1" (necessity statement)
- "could you book healthcare" → "1" (polite request)
- "healthcare sounds good" → "1" (preference expression)
- "let's go with healthcare" → "1" (decision statement)
- "what about healthcare?" → "1" (inquiry)
- "healthcare please" → "1" (simple request)
- "the first one" → "1" (position reference)
- "option 1" → "1" (number reference)
- "the healthcare center" → "1" (full name)
- "just healthcare" → "1" (shortened name)

- "i want to select city lab" → "2" (direct statement)
- "can you choose city lab" → "2" (question format)
- "i have to pick city lab" → "2" (necessity statement)

- "just city lab" → "2" (shortened name)

- "i want to select medplus" → "3" (direct statement)
- "can you choose medplus" → "3" (question format)
- "i have to pick medplus" → "3" (necessity statement)

EXTREME FLEXIBILITY:

- Handle conversational: "that healthcare place", "the city lab place", "medplus sounds fine"
- Handle questions: "should I choose healthcare?", "is city lab good?", "what about medplus?"
- Handle comparisons: "healthcare vs city lab", "between city lab and medplus", "healthcare or medplus?"
- Handle uncertainty: "maybe healthcare", "thinking city lab", "probably medplus"
- Handle preferences: "I'd prefer healthcare", "leaning towards city lab", "medplus would be better"

OUTPUT FORMAT: Respond with ONLY:
- "1", "2", or "3" for the respective center
- "incomplete" for incomplete or unclear input that doesn't express a clear center preference
- "out_of_scope" for completely unrelated questions

INCOMPLETE INPUT EXAMPLES (respond "incomplete"):
- "I would like to" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)
- "I want" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)
- "Can you" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)

    case 'time_selection':
      return `${basePrompt}

CONTEXT: User is choosing appointment time. Available times are between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM.
The system can book ANY time in this range, not just the main options shown to users.

Your task: Extract the EXACT time the user mentions from their natural language input.

CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Look for ANY time expression in the user's input (like "9:00 a.m.", "8:30 AM", "7:15")
2. Extract ONLY the time that is explicitly mentioned - do not infer or guess
3. Ignore conversational filler words ("preferred", "will be", "I'll", etc.)
4. Return the EXACT time in standard "H:MM AM" format
5. If no time is mentioned, return "invalid"
6. Only accept times between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
- Scan the entire input for time patterns
- Extract the first valid time found
- Convert any time format to standard "H:MM AM" format
- Ignore all other conversational content

TIME PATTERN EXAMPLES:
- "9:00 a.m. Will be I'll preferred." → "9:00 AM"
- "8:30 am is good for me" → "8:30 AM"
- "I would like 7:15 AM" → "7:15 AM"
- "Can we do 8:00 am?" → "8:00 AM"
- "9:00 a.m. works" → "9:00 AM"
- "7:45 in the morning please" → "7:45 AM"

CONVERSATIONAL EXAMPLES:
- "9:00 a.m. Will be I'll preferred." → "9:00 AM"
- "I think 8:30 am would be better" → "8:30 AM"
- "Maybe 7:15 AM could work" → "7:15 AM"
- "How about 8:00 am?" → "8:00 AM"
- "9:00 a.m. sounds perfect" → "9:00 AM"

GENERAL TIME EXAMPLES (return exact time format):
- "i want to select 7 am" → "7:00 AM"
- "can you choose 8 am" → "8:00 AM"
- "i have to pick 9 am" → "9:00 AM"
- "7 am sounds good" → "7:00 AM"
- "8 am please" → "8:00 AM"
- "7" → "7:00 AM"
- "8" → "8:00 AM"
- "9" → "9:00 AM"
- "7 o'clock" → "7:00 AM"
- "8 o'clock" → "8:00 AM"
- "9 o'clock" → "9:00 AM"

SLOT NUMBER EXAMPLES (return slot number - only when user explicitly refers to position):
- "the first one" → "1"
- "the second one" → "2"
- "the third one" → "3"

RELATIVE REFERENCES (return slot number):
- "the earliest" → "1"
- "the latest" → "3"
- "first slot" → "1"
- "middle slot" → "2"
- "last slot" → "3"

INVALID TIME HANDLING:
- Times outside 7-9 AM range: "6 pm", "10 am", "5 pm", "noon", "midnight", "2 pm"
- No time mentioned: "I prefer morning", "that sounds good", "okay"
- Respond with "invalid" for any time not available or no time found

OUTPUT FORMAT: Respond with ONLY:
- Exact time in "H:MM AM" format for specific times (e.g., "8:30 AM")
- "1", "2", or "3" for position-based slot references
- "incomplete" for incomplete or unclear input that doesn't express a clear time preference
- "invalid" for times not available or no time found
- "out_of_scope" for completely unrelated questions

INCOMPLETE INPUT EXAMPLES (respond "incomplete"):
- "I would like to" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)
- "I want" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)
- "Can you" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)
- "I would" → "incomplete" (incomplete phrase)
